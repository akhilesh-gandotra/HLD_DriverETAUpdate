# HLD_DriverETAUpdate
HLD for Driver ETA update on Mobile


# Problem Statement
Imagine a delvery app where the driver gets the real time ETA updates while reaching the customer and on getting the update the ETA screen should be updated. Make sure you think about the energy resources of the device.

# Requirements

- The driver needs to get the eta
- Save the phone's energy
- The mechanism should be robust
- Update the eta whithout any glitch on screen

# Thoughtprocess

As this is the driver's ETA which will only change when he travels some distance so we dont require the update every second, ideally in a city if the driver is travelling at 30-40km/hr its natural that it will take him 10-15 to travel around 200-300m which can lead to change in the ETA(in minutes)
So we should not require sockets, we can go ahead with an API call which can recalled after say 10s.
There can be scenarios where there are jams or somehow the driver is stuck for a while, where the 10s call might be wasteful as there will be no ETA change. For such scenarios we can include a `significantLocationChange`(https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/startmonitoringsignificantlocationchanges()) API which is available with Apple `CLLocation` service. We can device a logic where if the significant distance is not moved there is no point in calling the ETA API thereby saving resources for both mobile and server.

Once the API is called we will receive ETA in the response which can be parsed and shown on the UI, by updating UI on the main thread. Parsing and conversion can be done on some other thread asyncronously to prevent any glitches on UI.

There can also be some problems related to network as the driver would be travelling, so would need to handle for low to zero network also, where we can show the network banner if the network is bad, we would also need to implement retry mechanisms during timeouts and it would not be possible for the driver to do so while travelling so we can automatically do some X retries while having network failures.

Follow ups:

- Why did you choose 10s interval? Answer given in the thoughtprocess.
- What else could you chosen instead of time. (Answered by significant location change)
- Should we use caching in usecase? No need as we require realtime, everytime user launches the app/updates he should get the new ETA
- How do you handle the low network scenarios?
- How many times should retry take place? 
  Answer: That depends on the api timeout, usually in a good network the call should respond within 1-2s, Lets keep the time out interval as 5s, so based on that we can have max of 1 retry as after that, it will be time for the next API call.
- Think from a customer perspective who is waiting for the order. What else would you add in the above approach so that the eta on the customer(not driver) is always updating and not stuck. Can you list any scenarios where the eta call does not happen?
Answer: Except for the network changes, there can be scenarios where the driver have put the app in the background/may be he received some call. During these times, we will need to activate Background Tasks. 
We can define one Bg Task which can do the same logic of calling the ETA API in the background. When the driver returns to the foreground, we can kill the bg task and resume our normal operation.

‚úÖ Pros

| Aspect                        | Strength                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîã **Battery Efficiency**     | Smart use of `significantLocationChange` avoids constant GPS + API hits. Excellent for city environments. |
| üåê **Network Efficiency**     | Reduces unnecessary requests (when driver is stationary or stuck in traffic).                             |
| üß† **Intelligent Throttling** | ETA is only recalculated when there's meaningful movement. Avoids wasteful computation.                   |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Scalability**             | API polling every 10s per driver is reasonable at scale, especially with suppression logic.               |
| üö´ **Socket Avoidance**       | Avoiding persistent sockets simplifies architecture and saves mobile + backend resources.                 |
| üì± **Good UX**                | UI parsing async = smooth user experience. Network banners = clear user communication.                    |
| üîÑ **Resilience**             | Automatic retries during network failures = good offline/poor connectivity support.                       |


‚ö†Ô∏è Cons & Caveats
| Concern                                                         | Notes                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üìâ **Missed ETA update in high-speed scenarios**                | If a driver moves fast (e.g., 80km/h highway), 10s interval might result in bigger ETA jumps ‚Äî you could adjust polling based on speed.                           |
| üì∂ **Network detection isn‚Äôt perfect**                          | Even with retry logic, intermittent drops may delay updates unless you're monitoring reachability continuously.                                                   |
| üõë **SignificantLocationChange ‚â† Small but Relevant Movements** | It's coarse-grained (500m+) ‚Äî you may **miss updates** if the ETA changes within that range (e.g., new traffic jam just 200m ahead).                              |
| ‚ùÑÔ∏è **App in suspended state**                                    | If iOS suspends the app and significant location updates don‚Äôt fire, no polling happens ‚Äî might require fallback like silent push or local notification reminder. |
| ü§ñ **Complex state management**                                 | Implementing suppression logic + retries + reachability + UI update queues adds complexity that must be tested thoroughly.                                        |
